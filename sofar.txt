       - [polling unit -> parties and score, total]
       - Relevant tables :  announced_pu_results and polling_unit. RElationship : polling_unit.uniqueid = announced_pu_results.polling_unit_uniqueid
 2. Create a Page to display summed total result of all polling units under any local government ()
     - A page has a drop-down;

- polling_unit.lga_id = lga.lga_id ) -- 35
3. Create a new polling unit
   - with parties
   - and results.
   - save to data base - delta.. unit..
     - 
NEXT STEP. Examine data base.
Find relationship - done
Relevant tables : - done
Next step - watch videos on node and react.
refresh knowledge on node.
